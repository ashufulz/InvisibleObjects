# InvisibleObjects

Tried this for 'Invisible Cloak' like in Harry Potter's movie.
Can also be used to make any object invisible by fine tuning the HSV values of that respective object in the trackbar.
The logic is pretty simple.
Captures the reference frame/image, starts capturing your current activity and as per your HSV Tracker's values makes the object invisible.
